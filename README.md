# HighWaterMark
High water marks are used to compute the performance fees paid to a hedge fund by its investors. When I was interning at an investment company, I was asked to look into the situation in which a hedge fund falls so far under its high water mark (as happened in 2008-2009) that its managers have little chance of earning a performance fee for several years to come. The investment company was interested in restructuring their contracts with the hedge funds in which they invested which found themselves in this situation.
